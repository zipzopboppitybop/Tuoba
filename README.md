## Technologies Used

I utilized the following technologies to develop SPORK:

- **Node.js**: A server-side runtime environment that enabled me to build scalable and high-performance applications.
- **React**: A JavaScript library that helped me create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container that helped me manage complex application state across components.
- **Flask**: A micro web framework that allowed me to build the backend of our application with Python.
- **Python**: A high-level programming language that enabled me to implement complex functionality with ease.
- **SQLAlchemy**: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that provided a high-level interface for working with my PostgreSQL database.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful open-source relational database that provided a robust and scalable data storage solution.

## Lessons Learned

Through this project, I learned that full stack engineering is one of the most demanding jobs out there. Along with having to deal with the front and back end logic I had to also completely design the project myself and that really took a toll on my creativity and software engineering skills in general.


Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience, and I look forward to applying the skills and knowledge I gained to future projects.
