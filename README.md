## Technologies Used

I utilized the following technologies to develop SPORK:

- **Node.js**: A server-side runtime environment that enabled us to build scalable and high-performance applications.
- **React**: A JavaScript library that helped us create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container that helped us manage complex application state across components.
- **Flask**: A micro web framework that allowed us to build the backend of our application with Python.
- **Python**: A high-level programming language that enabled us to implement complex functionality with ease.
- **SQLAlchemy**: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that provided a high-level interface for working with our PostgreSQL database.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful open-source relational database that provided a robust and scalable data storage solution.

## Lesson Learned

Through this project, we learned the importance of effective communication and collaboration when working on a team. We found that it was essential to establish clear goals and expectations at the outset of the project, and to maintain open lines of communication throughout the development process.

We also learned the value of leveraging existing tools and frameworks to streamline development and improve efficiency. By utilizing technologies like Node.js, React, and SQLAlchemy, we were able to build a robust and scalable application in a relatively short amount of time.

Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience, and we look forward to applying the skills and knowledge we gained to future projects.
